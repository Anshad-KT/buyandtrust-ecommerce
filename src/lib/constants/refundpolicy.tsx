export const REFUND_POLICY = `REFUND POLICY

After successful verification of the returned product at our warehouse, a full refund will be issued, excluding the shipping charges (as we are unable to refund the initial shipping cost).

Refunds will be processed in accordance with applicable RBI guidelines and notifications, and may take an additional 7–14 business days to reflect in your account after approval.

For information on eligibility and how to send a return, please see our Return Policy.`
